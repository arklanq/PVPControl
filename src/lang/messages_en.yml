#This is the translation file where you can define your own translations, aliases, prefixes and much much more!
#100% of plugin messages are fully translatable!
#You can use in some places special variables like %command%, %usage% etc. but it works only for certian entries where variables list was defined in a comment.
#Have on mind that if you want to do a "hard-enter" you need to use \n variable and surround your text with double quotes!
